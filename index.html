  <h4>
  	<font color= #1f618d>
  	Just got curious today, also, its the time of the year people try to get into healthy habits so tried to compare the google search trends of popular diets and tried to make sense of it. 
  </font>
</h4>
  		<p>
  	<ul>
  		<li>Ketogenic diet</li>
  		<li>Low-Carbohydrate diet</li>
  	  	<li>Atkins diet</li>
  	  	<li>Paleolithic diet, and</li>
  	  	<li>Intermittent Fasting (Not a diet but heard from couple of people in the past few weeks)</li>
  </ul>
</p>

  <p><strong>
  	<font color= #1f618d>
  	Which Diet is more popular?<br>
  </font>
  </strong>
  <ul>
  	<li>Looking at the chart, Ketogenic diet is the most popular one for the past couple of years but it appears to have to reached his peak and slowly the popularity is going down.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p><strong>
  	<font color= #1f618d>
  	Do people search more about diets during the New Year?<br>
  </font>
  </strong>
  		<ul>
  	<li>Yes, they do. Check the chart around the end of December and Jan time for each year and you will notice that there are more  searches around that time of the year compared to other weeks/months</li></ul>
